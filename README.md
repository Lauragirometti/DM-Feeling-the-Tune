# DM-Feeling-the-Tune
This is a project group work for Data Managment course.
This project aims to create a comprehensive NoSQL database focused on singers participating in the 2023 Sanremo Music Festival. My collegues and I gather data from diverse online sources, including magazines, Spotify, and Twitter. This database provides insights into public sentiment towards artists, their pre-festival popularity, and early performance assessments. Our goal is to facilitate an in-depth analysis of song and artist sentiment, comparing it with pre-existing popularity and critical song reviews.
